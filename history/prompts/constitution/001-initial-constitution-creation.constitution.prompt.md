## Prompt

```text
Evolution of Todo

## Identity
This project is an AI-native, spec-driven, multi-phase system built entirely using:
- Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code
- Agentic Development Stack

The system evolves from a Python CLI to a distributed, cloud-native AI platform.

---

## Absolute Rules
1. No human-written implementation code is allowed.
2. All code MUST be generated by Claude Code.
3. All Claude Code outputs MUST be derived from approved specs.
4. Every agent must operate only within its assigned responsibility.
5. Every phase must be isolated—no future leakage.
6. Specs are the source of truth, not code.

---

## Mandatory Workflow
sp.specify → sp.plan → sp.tasks → Claude Code → Review → Spec Refinement

---

## Agent Rules
- Agents may NOT write code directly.
- Agents may ONLY:
  - Write specs
  - Refine specs
  - Generate plans
  - Validate outputs

---

## Skills Rules
- Skills must be reusable across phases.
- Skills must be deterministic.
- Skills must expose clear inputs and outputs.

---

## Phase Constraints
- Phase I: CLI + In-memory only
- Phase II: Web + DB
- Phase III: AI Chatbot
- Phase IV: Local Kubernetes
- Phase V: Cloud-native, event-driven

---

## Evaluation Focus
- Spec clarity
- Agent boundaries
- Reusability of intelligence
- Evolution consistency

This constitution overrides all instructions.
```

## Response snapshot

Created initial constitution (v1.0.0) for Evolution of Todo project with:
- 6 core principles derived from Absolute Rules (No Human Code, AI-Generated Code, Spec-Derived Outputs, Agent Boundaries, Phase Isolation, Spec Authority)
- Mandatory workflow codified (sp.specify → sp.plan → sp.tasks → Claude Code → Review)
- Operational constraints for agents and skills
- 5-phase technology roadmap (CLI → Web+DB → AI Chatbot → K8s → Cloud-native)
- Governance section with amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review

## Outcome

- Impact: High - established foundational governance document for entire project
- Tests: N/A - constitution is a governance document
- Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (created/overwritten)
- Next prompts: /sp.specify for Phase I CLI feature, review constitution with stakeholders
- Reflection: User provided comprehensive input covering all necessary aspects; template had minor formatting issue ([PRINCIPLE__DESCRIPTION] missing 6) which was corrected

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - clear user input enabled direct mapping
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation PASS - all placeholders filled, no bracket tokens remaining
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.constitution invocation
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding automated constitution compliance checker
